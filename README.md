Hi, I'm @Jachimo!

In addition to GitHub, I also use GitLab, and I'm [@Jachimo over there as well](https://gitlab.com/Jachimo).

Most of my projects are tools created to solve problems I've run into,
although I also have some experimental art projects, and forks of existing projects
that I created for one reason or another.

Things I'm interested in:

- Python (usually my first stop when I start writing something)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Text Processing & ETL
- AI/ML (particularly as applied to text)
- CircuitPython & MicroPython (generally on the ESP8266)
- Metadata and Structured Text (including abusing RFC822/MIME `.eml` files as a container format)
- Obsidian, Logseq, Evernote, and other "Tools For Thought"
- Long-term digital preservation and archiving
